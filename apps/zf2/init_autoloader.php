/**
 * This autoloading setup is really more complicated than it needs to be for most
 * applications. The added complexity is simply to reduce the time it takes for
 * new developers to be productive with a fresh skeleton. It allows autoloading
 * to be correctly configured, regardless of the installation method and keeps
 * the use of composer completely optional. This setup should work fine for
 * most users, however, feel free to configure autoloading however you'd like.
